													<h3>Formative Years</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Hamilton was the first teacher hired at the Old Town School of Music when it opened in 1957. His specific way of teaching was appealing because it required no prior knowledge of music or formal training.</p>
												<p>The school is still in operation today, feel free to explore their website!</p>

													<h3>Hamilton in Action</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Take a look at how Hamilton teaches the 5-string banjo using a tablature system. He breaks down the notes into specific finger placements, making sure that students can understand without knowing how to read sheet music. </p>
												<p>After leaving Chicago and OTSFM, he started his own school in Decatur, Georgia. Check it out below! </p>

													<h3>The Philosophy of Old Town School of Folk Music</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Hamilton was all about bringing people into the fold, and had a philosophy that everyone is a musician. He states, “We wanted to see involvement by people who wouldn’t normally think they had musical talent and bring out whatever they had" (Lee, 2011).</p>
												<p>He even created his own way of teaching students how to play what notes. He did this by inventing his own tablature systems which have students learn what finger positions produce certain notes, rather than teaching them to read music. In establishing the OTSFM, he thought, “what ways can we take the music and make it accessible to people? What’s the most convenient way to do that" (Lee, 2011). The answer was simple to him: "we started notational systems, tablature systems". This proved important, "Because I knew they’d have a phobia about it", where "it" is the ability to read sheet music. </p>
												<p>This way of teaching became extremely popular as it didnt require, "any of this baggage by the academic community to enter into it” (Lee, 2011). Thus, it invited students that would not normally find themselves in a music class to give playing an instrument a chance.</p>
												<p>He also used popular songs of the time to teach his students music, rather than relying on music that his students would be unfamiliar with, "as the Folk Boom became history and the 1970s brought a wider field of popular music genres to choose from, the need for teachers to rely on popular songs instead of traditional songs as the entry point for students continued to increase” (Lee, 2011).</p>	
												<p>Safe to say, Frank Hamilton broke norms by teaching in this way, but at the same time he was successful in breaking the stigma around learning an instrument and providing a safe space for students to learn.</p>

													<h3>An Interview with Dr. James Mack</h3>
												</header>
												<p>In this 45 minute interview from the Library of Congress, James Mack gives an outstanding look into his life and perspective behind the music he was making and teaching.</p>
												<p>Below, James Mack describes his work at Crane Junior College. It starts with Mack explaining the story of how he taught and tried to keep students engaged in classical music when they really wanted to be playing jazz.</p>
													<audio controls autoplay>
														<source src="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/media/afc/afc1981004/afc1981004_afs20639_01.mp3#t=230" type="audio/mp3">
													  </audio>

												<p>Mack says, "I tried to sell them on the idea of being universal in terms of their musical abilities. If they want to play jazz or whatever, or they want to play rock, I want them to be able to play any kind of idiom because success in the music industry hinges upon versatility".</p>
												<p>Mack pushed students to learn outside of their comfort zone but says, "I had to keep them interested, so that meant bringing everything back to jazz". Mack even tought his students life skills like typing. This displays his intense desire to see his students succeed in whatever direction life may take them, even if that is outside music.</p>

												<h3>The Fundamentals of Teaching - Breaking Barriers</h3>
												<p>In his own words, the best aspect of himself as a teacher was to eliminate any hinderances that might get in the way of his students. Take a listen below:</p>
												<audio controls autoplay>
													<source src="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/media/afc/afc1981004/afc1981004_afs20639_01.mp3#t=630" type="audio/mp3">
												  </audio>
												<p>Mack says, “I would easily say that all my total development in the field of music commercially, politically, and every way has come out of my fundamental function as a teacher and to do whatever was necessary to knock down any barriers, whether they be artistic, political, union, or whatever, that kept the young musicians from reaching their potential and that denied them opportunities that I thought that their talent deserved”.</p>
												<p>Mack saw teaching music as a way for him to change the lives of the students in his classes. More importantly, he saw that he could positively influence lives by tackling the hard things that might have plagued their lives. This includes facing racism in the industry, the guises of poverty, and the recording studios that may have stood in their way.</p>
												
												<h3>Teaching the Legends</h3>
												<p>Mack's success in teaching talented musicians speaks for itself, Mack’s students took all of the lessons from Mack and applied them professionally. Some of the students that trained under Mack include Tom Washington, Nancy Wilson, Jerry Butler, Tyrone Davis, Della Reese, Walter Jackson, Little Milton, Verdine White, and founding members of Earth, Wind & Fire, Louis Satterfield, Don Myrick, and Maurice White (Cohen, 2019)</p>

													<h3>Mack's Classical Influence</h3>
												</header>
												<p>James Mack grew up on the south side of Chicago where he attended Chorpus Christi Grammar School. It was here where he learned the essence of classical music. His mom could barely afford to keep her kids in this school, but did whatever she could for them to get a good education.</p>
												<p>In high school, he went to another Roman Catholic affiliated school where he learned the flute, and was surrounded by elements of formal Western music theory his entire educational career. As he was introduced to jazz in the community he lived in, he brought classical elements to the way he played.</p>
												<a class="image featured"><img src="images/mack.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<p>Mack brought his personal background in music to Crane Junior College where he, “taught students to incorporate classical theories and techniques into jazz, soul, and pop”.</p>

										<h3>Bringing Real-Life Lessons to Music</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Captain Waltery Dyett brought a militant, sometimes harsh style to teaching his students. His attitude was just as serious when it came to preparing his students for life outside of high school. One of his students said, “while Dyett was training people to be musicians, he used to say he didn’t care if students never picked up a musical instrument after high school. He was teaching them life lessons” (Bush, 2014). He aimed at taking down the barriers to success in life, whether that meant pursuing music or not.</p>
									<p>Dyett even wrote in his own thesis, "In any work, it is first necessary for us to know ourselves. The better we become acquainted with our own shortcomings by the constant cooperation of what we do with what we wish to do, or should be doing, the more able we are to see the difficulties and their penetrating causes in the work of our students. We are more sympathetic and understanding. The old adage, 'Know Thyself' is a prime essential for good teaching or good living”. Dyett was aware of the "penetrating causes" that impacted his students. He realized that many of his students grew up in poverty and were being called to provide for their families. His goal was to tackle some of the challenges his students had in reaching their full potential, “Regardless of how talented his music students might have been, however, Dyett insisted that each take private lessons. For those who couldn't afford it, Dyett leaned on musician friends to teach the kids for pennies" (Chicago Tribune, 1998).</p>
									<p>Dyett created a week-long concert series that gave the students at DuSable High School. The reason behind the concert was to raise money for the proper musical instruments as, "the Chicago Board of Education wasn't going to provide the musical instruments his band required" (Chicago Tribune, 1998). Money proved to be a huge barrier to many of his students. He tackled that head on. Fred Hopkins notes, "He made us very angry, but he also went beyond that--he found a way to connect with you. When I didn't have my own bass, because my family was poor, he let me take home the school's bass" (Chicago Tribune, 1998).</p>

									<h3>The Need for Outstanding Music Educators</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Recently, music education has been under siege, with COVID-19 derailing the education of so many young people. With shrinking educational budgets, the performing arts are often some of the first programs to get cut. The challenges facing music education are daunting, but that is why it is crucial that educators play a role in challenging this trend. In studying prominent music educators in Chicago, we have seen that lives can be changed through music, and that all starts with music education. But that only happens when educators are willing to tear down the walls that separate their students from accessing education.</p>
								<p>Professor DeAngelis mentioned at the end of the final class session, "I hope you all believe that you are musican people, because you all are". This sentiment should be held by all music educators, as it was by Frank Hamilton, James Mack, and Capt. Walter Dyett. Not only that, but music educators have the opportunity to tackle the challenges that students face in their lives, and accessing music education.</p>
